Features:

This backend project is built using Flask, a lightweight and flexible web framework for building RESTful APIs
It utilizes python-dotenv to securely manage environment variables from a .env file, allowing configuration to remain outside the codebase. 
For cloud storage operations, boto3 is integrated to interact with AWS S3 services, enabling file uploads and downloads. 
Image processing tasks, such as resizing or format conversion, are handled using Pillow. 
Geolocation features are supported via geopy with the Nominatim geocoder, allowing the translation of addresses into geographic coordinates. 
Logging and debugging are enhanced through Abseil logging, which provides structured and flexible logging capabilities. 
Finally, a custom Snowflake connector module is used to interact with the Snowflake cloud data warehouse, managing secure database operations and queries efficiently.
