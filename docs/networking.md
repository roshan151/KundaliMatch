I am using a load balancer to route requests to my EC2 but when i make the call:
curl -X POST https://lovebhagya.com:8080/verify:email \
  -F 'metadata={"email": "example@example.com"}'
it times out: url: (28) Failed to connect to lovebhagya.com port 8080 after 75003 ms: Could not connect to server

‚Äî means your Load Balancer (or something before it) cannot reach your EC2 instance on port 8080. Here's how to troubleshoot this step-by-step:

‚úÖ Step 1: Double-check port exposure on your EC2
Ensure your Flask app is running on port 8080 and listening on 0.0.0.0:

python
Copy
Edit
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
If it's 127.0.0.1, it won't accept traffic from the Load Balancer.

‚úÖ Step 2: Check your EC2 Security Group
Ensure the EC2 instance's security group allows inbound traffic on port 8080:

Protocol: TCP

Port range: 8080

Source: Load Balancer's security group or 0.0.0.0/0 (for testing only)

‚úÖ Step 3: Check Load Balancer Configuration
Listener: Does your ALB or NLB have a listener on port 8080 (for HTTPS or HTTP)?

Target group:

Health checks are passing?

Protocol: HTTP (or HTTPS if your app is SSL-configured)

Port: 8080

Target type: instance or IP

‚úÖ Step 4: Try to connect directly to EC2
SSH into your EC2 instance and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://localhost:8080/verify:email
If it works, then the app is healthy internally. Now, try from your local machine using the EC2's public IP:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8080/verify:email
If this fails, it's definitely a network or firewall/security group issue.

‚úÖ Step 5: Check if HTTPS is really running on 8080
If you're running SSL/TLS (https://) on port 8080, make sure:

Flask is running with SSL context:

python
Copy
Edit
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, ssl_context=("cert.pem", "key.pem"))
Your Load Balancer should either:

Forward HTTPS (port 443) to HTTP 8080 (terminate SSL at ALB)

Or pass through SSL to HTTPS 8080 (if EC2 terminates SSL)

üî• Suggestion
By convention:

ALB: Expose HTTPS on port 443

Backend Flask app: Run on port 8080 HTTP (no SSL)

Let ALB handle SSL termination

üß™ Test example
Try this after verifying all the above:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -v http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8080/verify:email -F 'metadata={"email": "example@example.com"}'
If that works, problem lies in:

Load Balancer config

DNS routing

SSL termination setup

Would you like to share your ALB setup or your Flask app.run(...) line and your EC2 security group config? I can help fine-tune based on that.

What is the difference between security group and target group?


ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî Security Group and Target Group are both used in AWS networking, but they serve very different purposes. Here's a clear comparison:

üîê Security Group (Firewall rules for EC2, Load Balancer, etc.)
What it is: A virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to AWS resources (like EC2 instances or Load Balancers).

Attached to: EC2 instances, Load Balancers, RDS, etc.

Controls: Who (IP, port, protocol) can connect to or be connected from your instance.

Example:

Allow inbound TCP on port 22 from your IP (for SSH)

Allow inbound TCP on port 8080 from a load balancer's security group

‚úÖ Think of this as: "Who can talk to my EC2 instance and on what port?"

üéØ Target Group (Routing backend group for Load Balancers)
What it is: A group of backend servers (e.g., EC2s) that the Load Balancer routes traffic to.

Attached to: Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB)

Controls:

Which instances are in the group

What port traffic is forwarded to (e.g., port 8080)

How health checks are performed

Example:

Target Group: contains 2 EC2 instances

Port: 8080

Health Check: HTTP GET /healthz every 30s

‚úÖ Think of this as: "Where should the load balancer send incoming traffic?"

üß† Analogy
Imagine you're organizing a party:

Security Group is your guest list and door bouncer ‚Äî controls who gets in.

Target Group is your waiter‚Äôs list of tables to serve ‚Äî controls where the food (traffic) goes inside.

üîÑ How They Work Together
Let‚Äôs say:

Your Flask app runs on EC2 at port 8080.

ALB listens on port 443 (HTTPS).

Target group routes requests to port 8080 on EC2.

Then you must:

Security Group on EC2: Allow inbound traffic on port 8080 from the ALB‚Äôs security group.

Target Group: Include your EC2 instance, forwarding to port 8080.

Health Check: Should hit a working endpoint (like /health) on port 8080.
